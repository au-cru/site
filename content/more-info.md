## About

### Vision

Reproducibility, open scientific practices, and analytic transparency are
increasingly being requested or required of scientists and researchers, but
training on these on topics is severely lacking. Nor has the culture around
sharing of code and skills, or even the recognition that these concepts are
important for the health of science, dramatically changed. 

Our *vision* is to create a community of (open) research software users
at Aarhus University and the surrounding area to share, learn, and support each
other, so that we may better use our tools in our research. We hope to start
forming a culture of sharing, openness, and improvement in scientific
activities, so that we may start bridging the gaps in knowledge and skills
around making scientific practices more reproducible, transparent, and rigorous.

### Mission

To acheive our vision, our mission is to:

- Host and organize peer-led teaching sessions to share skills and knowledge of using open software for research.
- Advertise and promote events and activities related to training and learning on using open software.
- Provide a support network for new and experienced users.
- Provide lists of recommended and high quality resources for learning.

## Calendar Integration {#add-calendar}

Do you use **Google**? Add the calendar with [this link](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=2ss4h917ttbik93jp4n7kkto5o%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Europe%2FCopenhagen).
