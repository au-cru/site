```{r setup, echo=FALSE}
source(here::here("R/utils-for-content.R"))
knitr::opts_chunk$set(eval = FALSE)
```

## Session details

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c("usethis", "prodigenr", "drake", "styler"))
```

### Objectives

1. To become aware of and learn some "best practices" (or "good enough practices") for project organization.
1. To use RStudio to create and manage projects with a consistent structure.

**At the end of this session you will be able**:

- To apply the best practices in using R for data analysis.
- To create a new RStudio project with a consistent folder structure.
- To use styler for formatting your code.
- To organise folders in a consistent, structured and systematic way.

## Resources for learning and help

## Best practices overview[^note]

[^note]: Many of the best practices are taken from the "best practices" articles
listed in the "Resources".

The ability to read, understand, modify and write simple pieces of code is an
essential skill for modern data analysis. Here we introduce you to some of the
best practices one should have while writing their codes:

- Organise all source files in the same directory (use a common and consistent folder and file structure)
- Use version control (to track changes to files)
- Make data "read-only" (don't edit it directly) and use code to show what was done
- Write and describe code for people to read (be descriptive and use a [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/))
- Don't repeat yourself (use and create functions)

## Project management

Managing your projects in a reproducible fashion doesn't just make your science
reproducible, it also makes your life easier! RStudio is here to help us with
that by using projects!! RStudio projects make it straightforward to divide your
work into multiple contexts, each with their own working directory, workspace,
history, and source documents.

It is strongly recommended that you store *all* the necessary files that will
be used/sourced in your code in the **same directory**. You can then use the
respective relative path to access them. This makes the directory and R
Project a "product", or "bundle/package". Like a tiny machine, that needs to have
all it's component parts in the same place.

Let's create our first project!

### Creating your first project

RStudio projects are associated with R working directories. You can create an
RStudio project:

- In a brand new directory
- In an existing directory where you already have R code and data
- By cloning a version control (Git or Subversion) repository

There are many ways one could organise a project folder. We can set up a project
directory folder using [prodigenr](http://prodigenr.lukewjohnston.com/index.html),
using:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
prodigenr::setup_project("ProjectName")
```

...which will have the following folders and files:

```
ProjectName
├── R
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── fetch_data.R
│   └── setup.R
├── data
│   └── README.md
├── doc
│   └── README.md
├── .Rbuildignore
├── .gitignore
├── DESCRIPTION
├── ProjectName.Rproj
└── README.md
```

This forces a specific, and consistent, folder structure to all your work. Think 
of this like the "introduction", "methods", "results", and "discussion" sections 
of your paper. Each project is then like a single manuscript or report, that
contains everything relevant to that specific project. There is a lot of
powerful in something as simple as a consistent structure.

The README in each folder explains a bit about what should be placed there. But
briefly:

1. Documents are in the `doc/` directory.
1. Data, raw data, and metadata should be in either the `data/` directory (or
`data-raw/` for the very raw data).
1. All R files and code should be in the `R/` directory.
1. Name all new files to reflect their content or function. Follow the tidyverse 
[style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/files.html) for file naming.

And make sure to use version control (Git! See the [AUOC Git
material](https://au-oc.github.io/content/intro-git.html) for more details).

### Exercise: Better file naming

Time: 2 min

Think about these file names. Which file names should you use?

```
fit models.R
fit-models.R
foo.r
stuff.r
get_data.R
Manuscript version 10.docx
manuscript.docx
new version of analysis.R
trying.something.here.R
plotting-regression.R
utility_functions.R
code.R
```

### Advantages of this project setup

Projects are used to make life easier. Once a project is opened within RStudio
the following actions are taken:

- A new R session (process) is started.
- The `.Rprofile` file in the project's main directory (if any) is sourced by R.
- The current working directory is set to the project directory.
- RStudio project options are loaded.
- Consistent structure, so easier to remember where things are, and easier for
computers to do what they do best.

## Writing code

### Use a syntax style guide

Even though R doesn't care about naming, spacing, and indenting, it really matters
how your code looks. Coding is just like writing. Even though you may go through
a brainstorming note taking stage of writing, you eventually need to write correctly
so others can understand what you are trying to say. In coding, brainstorming is
fine, but eventually you need to code in a readable way.

#### Exercise: Make code more readable

Time: 6 min

Before we go more into this section, try to make these code more readable.
Edit the code so it's easier to understand what is going on.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Variable names
DayOne
dayone
T <- FALSE
c <- 9
mean <- function(x) sum(x)

# Spacing
x[,1]
x[ ,1]
x[ , 1]
mean (x, na.rm = TRUE)
mean( x, na.rm = TRUE )
function (x) {}
function(x){}
height<-feet*12+inches
mean(x, na.rm=10)
sqrt(x ^ 2 + y ^ 2)
df $ z
x <- 1 : 10

# Indenting
if (y < 0 && debug)
message("Y is negative")
```

### Automatic styling with styler

You have organised it by hand, however it is also possible to do it
automatically. The [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) has
helped people to follow standards styles and automatically re-style chunks of
code using an R package: [styler](http://styler.r-lib.org/). The styler snippets
can be found in the Addins function on the top of your R document.

Now, let's try using styler on the exercise code above.

### DRY and describing your code

DRY or "don't repeat yourself" is another way of saying, "make your own
functions"! That way you don't need to copy and paste code you've used multiple
times. Using functions also can make your code more readable and descriptive,
since a function is a bundle of code that does a specific task... and usually
the function name should describe what you are doing.

It is very important for your future self, and for any person that will be
reading/using your code to be able to understand what the **code**, **function**,
or **R Mardown** will generate. So it's crucial to describe what the code does,
acknowledge the author (if necessary), and give an example on how to execute it.
If your function name is well decriptive, then you don't need to spend much time
describing what the code does! In the AUOC session on [creating functions for
packages](https://au-oc.github.io/content/pkg-functions.html), we went into
detail about function documentation and creation. Here we will briefly cover the
core concepts.

Example:

```{r}
# Code developed by Maria Izabel
# The following function outputs the sum of two numeric variables (a and b). 
# usage: summing(a = 2, b = 3)
summing <- function(a, b) {
    return(a + b)
}

summing(a = 2, b = 3)
```

The example above is summing up two different numeric variables. Note that the
name for this function was chosen as **summing**, instead of **sum**. This is
because we know that R already has a built-in function called **sum** and
so we don't want to overwrite it!

### Loading packages

At the top of each script, you should put all your library calls for loading
your packages. Better yet, put all the library calls in a new file and `source()`
that file in each R script.

<!--
{{TODO: expand on this at later sessions}}

It is also very important to record in what package version the code was
executed. In order to avoid bugs due to package modification, one can always
install a specific version:

```{r, eval=F}
install_version("ggplot2", version = "0.9.1", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
```


comment on what possible functions important lines of the code would have. You can use the symbol **#** to make comments:

```{r}
# This function converts temperature in fahrenheit to kelvin
fahrenheit_to_kelvin <- function(temp_F) {
  temp_K <- ((temp_F - 32) * (5 / 9)) + 273.15
  return(temp_K) # it returns a numeric value
}

# The following function converts kelvin to celsius
kelvin_to_celsius <- function(temp_K) {
  temp_C <- temp_K - 273.15 # The 273.15 value is based on the Charle's Law.
  return(temp_C)
}

# The following function converts fahrenheit to celsius
fahrenheit_to_celsius <- function(fahrenheit_temperature) {
  kelvin_temperature <- fahrenheit_to_kelvin(fahrenheit_temperature) # first to kelvin
  celsius_temperature <- kelvin_to_celsius(kelvin_temperature) # And then kelvin to Celsius
  return(celsius_temperature)
}

```

I am over commenting it, since the name of the functions are quite self explanatory, one wouldn't need to comment as much.


### Data cleaning

In many cases your data will be "messy": it will need significant preprocessing to get into a format R (or any other programming language) will find useful. This task is sometimes called "data munging". I find it useful to store these scripts in a separate folder, and create a second "read-only" data folder to hold the "cleaned" data sets.

## Workflow and script management with drake

We'll cover this more during the session, but mainly at the end.
