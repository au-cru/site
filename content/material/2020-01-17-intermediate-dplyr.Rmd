```{r setup, echo=FALSE}
source(here::here("R/utils-for-content.R"))
options(tibble.print_max = 5,
        tibble.max_extra_cols = 15)
```

## Preparation

Please install the tidyverse package:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("tidyverse")
```

## Prerequisites

In this lesson, we assume a bit of familiarity with the basic functions of dplyr
(especially `group_by()` and `summarize()`), which we covered in the
[intro dplyr lesson](https://au-cru.github.io/site/material/2019-11-15-intro-dplyr/).

## Objectives

1. To know how to apply the `pivot_wider()` and `pivot_longer()` tidyr functions to
restructure your data between long and wide formats (and vice versa).
2. To use the `group_by()` and `summarize()` dplyr functions with the
`pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()` functions to apply more powerful and useful
wrangling techniques to your skills.
3. (If enough time) To apply common lubridate functions to easily wrangle pesky date variables.

## Why learn to reformat and reshape data?

Often we receive databases that have been created by others, and in which information is organized in a "messy" way. Some other times, we simply need to reorder the structure of the data to be able to carry out certain data analysis or data visualization that require a specific data structure. 

The tidyverse provides some very powerful packages (e.g. dplyr, tidyr) that can allow for complete reorganization of our data in a few lines of code. Using these packages and their functions have several advantages:

- It makes our lives easier and our work faster because we can jump between different 
formats of our data in an agile and easy-to-track way;

- It makes our work reproducible.

### Wide and long formats

One of the most common operations that we may need to do is to change the way our data is organized from a long (few columns, many rows) to a wide (few rows, many columns) format.

The illustrations below shows how the same information can be represented in a long and a wide format. Notice that the value (a-f) of each variable/key (x,y,z) can be read for each id (1, 2) in both formats.

![*Img: https://github.com/gadenbuie/tidyexplain*](https://github.com/gadenbuie/tidyexplain/raw/master/images/static/png/original-dfs-tidy.png){width=60%}

The functions we want to use for these operations are `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()` from the tidyr package. Those of you already familiar with this package may know the older functions as `spread()` and `gather()`. Although these two functions still work, they are being slowly replaced by the `pivot_**` functions.

### Get familiar with the data

Using the function `View()`, inspect the dataframe `population`, which shows the population census in different countries across multiple years.

Let's load tidyverse:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


```{r, eval = FALSE}
View(population)
```


### Reshape a dataframe from a long to a wide format with `pivot_wider()`

Say that we want to explore how the population varies across years in each country. 
To do this we may want to show each single country as a separate variable (i.e. column). 

This requires reshaping the data so that each single country now listed under the variable `country` 
becomes an individual variable (i.e. column), under which the population numbers, 
now listed under the variable `population`, are listed.

To do so, we will use the function `pivot_wider()` because we want to create 
a wider dataframe with more columns (the single countries), and fewer rows.

We will call this new dataframe `population_wide`.
In the function `pivot_wider()` we want to specify three arguments: 

- the dataframe to work on,
- the argument `names_from`: where we indicate the name of the "long" variable that we will use to create the new "wide" variables 
- the argument `values_from`: the values that we will use to fill the rows of the new variable we created

```{r}
population_wide <- 
  pivot_wider(population, names_from = country, values_from = population) 

population_wide
```

We can run the exact same operation taking advantage of the pipe operator `%>%`
that we showed in the intro session. If the memory is foggy, imagine this operator as an
arrow that connects consecutive functions in a smooth way. 

When using the pipe operator we are indicating that the functions will be applied to the 
dataframe `population`, so we do not need to indicate that into the `pivot_wider()` function arguments.

```{r}
population_wide <- population %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = country, values_from = population) 

population_wide
```


#### Exercise 1: Reshaping a dataframe from long to wide format
Use the dataframe `us_rent_income` for this exercise. This dataframe shows the estimated value and the 90%
margin of error for yearly income and monthly rent of each state in the US.

In this case, you want to display the data in wide form to see how estimated income varies across states.
To do so, each state will become a variable (i.e. column) to which the estimated income will be associated

```{r, eval=FALSE}
us_income_wide <- us_rent_income %>% 
  # We are only interested in income and not in rent, 
  # so we will extract these variables of interest from our database
  filter(variable == "income") %>% 
  # We select only the variables of interest to remain in our dataframe
  select(NAME, variable, estimate) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = ______, values_from = _____)

us_income_wide
```

> Advanced: Try selecting both `estimate` and `moe`, and include both in the pivot. Make the name indicate whether the value is the estimate or the moe (e.g. 'moe_Alabama'). 

### Reshape a dataframe from a wide to a long format using `pivot_longer()`

We can also do the opposite: a shift from a dataframe in wide format to a dataframe in long format. 
Let's consider the `population_wide` dataframe that we just created as the starting point. 
Let's say that we want to reshape this data to a format in which all countries are listed under a single variable, e.g. `country_name`, and the population data are listed under a variable called `population_data`. For this operation, we need to use the function `pivot_longer()`.

In this case, we want to specify:

- the argument `names_to`: the name of the new variable under which we want to group our columns, 
- the argument `values_to`: the name of the new variable under which we want to group the values of our variables.

We run this function...

```{r, error=TRUE}
population_wide %>%
  pivot_longer(names_to = "Country", values_to = "Population")
```

... but we get an error message!

This is because we did not specify which columns to shift into a long format.

  > In `pivot_wider()`, if no argument is given to `id_cols` it defaults to select all columns. However, `pivot_longer` has no default for `cols`, and will throw an error if no argument is given.

We could select every column, with the [tidyselect](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html#select) helper function `everything()`. This function tells `pivot_longer()` to use all the columns in the dataset when converting to long form.

```{r}
population_wide %>%
  pivot_longer(everything(), names_to = "Country", values_to = "Population")
```

This breaks the row-wise relation between year and population, and is clearly not what we want. Instead, we specify that the variable `year` is not to be involved in the reshaping. Columns not involved in the reshape will be copied, to preserve the row-wise relations in the data. 

```{r}
population_wide %>%
  pivot_longer(-year, names_to = "country_name", values_to = "population_data")
```

We use the `-` here for `year` to tell `pivot_longer()` to *not* include (to *exclude*) the column `year` from being converted to long form.

**Notice that** in the function `pivot_longer()` the arguments `names_to` and `values_to` require "" because we are providing names of variables that need to be created. 
Instead, in the function `pivot_wider()` we are giving the arguments `names_from` and `values_from` variables that already exist, hence  the "" are not needed.

#### Exercise 2: Reshaping a dataframe from wide to long format

We will use again the `us_rent_income` dataframe for this exercise.
In this case we want the values of `estimate` and `moe` to be stacked in one single column called `value`, 
while the respective categories of `estimate` and `moe` should be described in a variable called `calculation`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
us_rent_income_long <- us_rent_income %>% 
  # this variable is a nuisance and is not giving information useful to us, 
  # so we will remove it 
  select(-GEOID) %>% 
  # When we want multiple variables, we combine them with `c()`.
  pivot_longer(c(______, ______), names_to = ________, values_to = _________)

us_rent_income_long
```

### `pivot_**` with `group_by()` and `summarize()`

For this example we are going to use the built-in dataframe `storms`

Once again, explore the data using the function `View()`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
View(storms)
```

In this dataframe, information about storms are classified in long format. 
Storms are categorized across years and information on wind, latitude, longitude and pressure 
are presented as columns.

Let's say that we want to see how mean wind speed vary across 
different storm categories (`status`) and across years. 

This means that we want to apply the function `pivot_wider()` to visualize each storm category as a separate variable.

However, before reshaping the dataframe in long form, we need to do some extra work. 
Take another look at the `storms` dataframe. Variables are measured multiple times within each year. 
So if we want to have a mean value of wind speed for each year, we need to use the functions `group_by()` and `summarize()` that we showed in the intro session. 

We are going to call this new dataframe `storm_wide`

First we will calculate the mean value of wind speed for each storm, across years 
and discriminating across storm status

```{r}
storms_sum <- storms %>% 
  #first we select the variable of interest to avoid an overcrowded dataframe
  select(status, year, wind, pressure) %>% 
  #second we tell R according to which criteria we want to summarize our data, i.e. we want to know the mean value of wind speed for each storm according to storm status and year
  group_by(status, year) %>% 
  summarize(mean_wind = mean(wind)) 

storms_sum
```

Now we can reshape the data into a wide format:

```{r}
storms_wide <- storms_sum %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = status, values_from = mean_wind)  

storms_wide
```

#### Exercise 3: using `group_by()` and `summarize()` in combination with `pivot_**()` functions to reshape a data frame

Using the dataframe `diamonds` use the functions `group_by()` and `summarize()` in combination with
`pivot_longer()`, `pivot_wider()` to reshape a database in which different values of cut correspond to mean values of x, y, z (tip: you need to use both pivot_longer and pivot_wider!)

The reshaped dataframe should look like this:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
diamonds_means <- diamonds %>% 
  select(cut, x, y, z) %>% 
  group_by(cut) %>% 
  summarize(x_mean = mean(x),
            y_mean = mean(y),
            z_mean = mean(z))


diamonds_long <- diamonds_means %>% 
  pivot_longer(-cut, names_to = "coordinate", values_to = "mean_coord")

diamonds_wide <-  diamonds_long %>% 
    pivot_wider(names_from = cut, values_from = mean_coord)
  
diamonds_wide
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
diamonds_means <- diamonds %>% 
  select(cut, x, y, z) %>% 
  group_by(___) %>% 
  summarize(x_mean = ____,
            y_mean = ____,
            z_mean = ____)


diamonds_reshaped <- diamonds_means %>% 
  pivot_ ______(____, names_ ___ = __________, values_ ___ = ___________) %>% 
  pivot_ ________(names_ ____ = ________, values_ ____ = __________)
  
diamonds_reshaped
```

> Advanced: Try creating the same dataframe without using `summarize()`. Instead, apply the `mean()` function using the `values_fn` parameter in `pivot_wider()`. How does this work?

### Tidying messy data

So far, we have only reshaped "clean" datasets, but a major use case for the `pivot_**` functions is tidying up messy data. 
In the example below, we will tidy a made up (but very realistic) table.

```{r}
blood_pressure <- tibble(
  id = 1:3, 
  bp_Sys_week1 = rnorm(3, 130, 5), bp_Dia_week1 = rnorm(3, 90, 5), weight_week1 = rnorm(3, 80, 10),
  bp_Sys_week2 = rnorm(3, 130, 5), bp_Dia_week2 = rnorm(3, 90, 5), weight_week2 = weight_week1 + rnorm(3),
  bp_Sys_week3 = rnorm(3, 130, 5), bp_Dia_week3 = rnorm(3, 90, 5), weight_week3 = weight_week2 + rnorm(3)
)

blood_pressure
```

The main problem in this dataset is that the variable names also include data (week number). We want to pivot this wide dataframe into a longer one, with each row containg an id, a week number, a systolic and a diastolic blood pressure and a weight. For this we use `pivot_longer()`.

We do not want to include `id` in the reshape, so we select every column except this with `-id` as the first argument.
We then separate the variable names (e.g. 'bp_Dia_week1') into the actual variable name ('bp_Dia') and the value of the week variable ('1'). 

This is done by setting the `names_sep` parameter to the string that seperates the variable name from the week value (here '_week'). 
Because we split each variable name into two, we must set `names_to` for both. We do this with the character vector `c('.value', 'week')`. 
The special value `'.value'` indicates that the corresponding substring of the original variable name will itself become a variable name for the values in the new dataframe.
This makes a lot more sense when you look at the output of the function. 
The parameter `names_ptypes` converts the variable `week` from a character to an integer.

```{r}
blood_pressure_long <- blood_pressure %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    -id, 
    names_sep = '_week', 
    names_to = c('.value', 'week'), 
    names_ptypes = list(week = integer())
  )

blood_pressure_long
```

In some cases you may want only one column with blood pressures, and a separate column indicating if the pressure is diastolic or systolic. 
We could pivot our `blood_pressure_long` even longer, but for the sake of demonstration, we will do it in one function call. 
Since `weight` cannot be separated in diastolic and systolic, we will first exclude this variable. 

```{r}
blood_pressure_longer <- blood_pressure %>% 
  select(-starts_with('weight')) %>% 
  pivot_longer(-id, 
               names_sep = '_(week)?', # Regular expression indicating to seperate by '_' and '_week'.
               names_to = c('.value','pressure_type', 'week'), 
               names_ptypes = list(week = integer()))

blood_pressure_longer
```

#### Exercise 4: Tidy this!

Your friend is doing a research project on lab mice. He is weighing the mice daily, and noting whether they are agitated. A sample of his dataset is shown below.

```{r, eval=TRUE}
mouse_weight <- tibble(
  day = 1:4, 
  mouse1.weight = rnorm(4, 90, 10), 
  mouse1_agitated = c(TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE),
  mouse2.weight = rnorm(4, 90, 10), 
  mouse2_agitated = c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE),
  mouse3.weight = rnorm(4, 90, 10),
  mouse3_agitated = c(FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE),
)

mouse_weight
```

He wants to convert this to a format that is appropriate for creating a line graph in ggplot2 (long format; columns: `id`, `day`, `weight`, `agitated`). You are asked to help. 

> Note that while this format is 'messy' and not optimal for programatic analysis, it may be a convenient, and less error prone, way of recording the data. That said, there is no excuse for the inconsistent column name seperator.

The reshaped dataframe should look like this:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
mouse_weight_long <- mouse_weight %>% 
  pivot_longer(-day, names_prefix = 'mouse',
               names_sep = '[._]',
               names_to = c('id', '.value')) %>% 
  select(id, everything())

mouse_weight_long
```


```{r, eval=FALSE}
mouse_weight_long <- ____

mouse_weight_long
```

> Tip: Try excluding the 'agitated' columns with select(-ends_with('agitated')), and pivot just the weight columns. Then tweak the function to accept both '.' and '_' as name seperators.

Also, try creating a line graph with one line per mouse, day on the x-axis, weight on the y-axis and nodes coloured by whether the mouse is agitated.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
mouse_weight_plot <- ggplot(mouse_weight_long, aes(____)) + 
  geom_line(____) +
  geom_point(____)

mouse_weight_plot
```

### (Optional) Handle dates with lubridate

Often enough, data are collected on the same subjects (in this case storm names) across time, this implied the use of dates. However, handling dates can become a bit of a headache if R does not recognize the format. 
The package lubridate helps specifically with this problem and allows to format dates in a way that can be unequivocally recognized by R.

Although lubridate is part of the tidyverse (and we do not need to install it separately), we need to call it separately because it does not get loaded when we load the tidyverse library.

```{r}
library(lubridate)
```

The best way to input dates (if you are the one doing the data input), is to create three separate columns for day, month, year.

Then we can use the function `ymd()` from the package lubridate in combination with the function `paste()` to create a date variable

```{r}
storms_with_date <- storms %>% 
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(year, month, day, sep = "-") )) 
storms_with_date
```

if you query the new dataframe using the function `View()` you can see that the new variable date is specifically formatted as a Date data type.

```{r}
str(storms_with_date)
```


<!-- ### Working with factors -->
<!-- Dataframe often contain factors. Factors are categorical variables that are assigned different levels, but are read by R as numbers.  -->
<!-- The package forcats provide some useful functions that facilitate working with factors.  -->
<!-- Here we illustrate just a few of them -->


<!-- ### convert categorical variables into factors -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- storms_cat <- storms %>%  -->
<!--   mutate(category_factor = as_factor(category))  -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ### Group levels of a factor together with fct_collapse -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- storms_cat <- storms_cat %>%  -->
<!--   mutate(broad_category = fct_collapse(category_factors,  -->
<!--                                        storm = c("-1","0"), -->
<!--                                        hurricane = c("1","2","3","4","5"))) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ### Change the name of the levels of a factor with fct_recode -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- storms_cat <- storms_cat %>%  -->
<!--   mutate(category_factor_long = fct_recode(broad_category, -->
<!--                                            "tropical storm" = "storm", -->
<!--                                            "hurricane" = "hurricane")) -->
<!-- ``` -->
