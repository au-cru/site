knitr::opts_chunk$set(eval = FALSE)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("rmarkdown")
```


### Objectives

1. To become aware of the importance of reproducibility of data analyses.
2. To learn how to generate high quality reports that can be shared with a broader audience.
3. To create reproducible documents interwoven with R code that can be run on updated or different data sets.
4. To use Rstudio not as a data science tool but also as a text editor and compiler!
5. To know where to go for continued learning.

**At the end of this session you will be able**:

- Create a new RMarkdown document.
- Write text, headers, citations, and other report writing tasks in Markdown.
- Insert R code chunks that will create figures, tables, or numbers.
- Generate an analytically reproducible Word or HTML document.

## Why try to be reproducible?

First of a couple of definitions to avoid confusion: 

**Replicability**: Repeating a study by performing independently an identical study.

**Reproducibility**: Generating the same exact results when using the same data and code. Hypothetically, if you gave someone your data,
your code, and your paper, would they be able to generate the exact same numbers
you report in your manuscript and in your tables and figures


Research shows
that this is not at all the case... even when the same researcher tries to
reproducible their own paper! A recent [survey](https://www.nature.com/news/polopoly_fs/1.19970!/menu/main/topColumns/topLeftColumn/pdf/533452a.pdf) indicated that 70% of researchers failed to reproduce another scientist's experiment and more than 50% was not able to reproduce their own results.  



Being reproducible and writing a reproducible document/manuscript does several
things for you:

1. Makes your science better.
2. [Makes you more efficient and productive](https://twitter.com/kcranstn/status/370914072511791104), since less time is spent between
coding and putting your results in the document, or in searching where you put your code, your graphs and your manuscript. 
3. Makes you more confident in your results, since what you report is what you 
actually got from the analysis.
4. Its actually a lot of fun! ;)


## What is R Markdown?

A [markup syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language) that allows you to write a plain text (e.g. R code and scripts) document that can convert to a range of document formats, such as Word, PDF, html.

In R Markdown it is possible to write text and integrate it with code. In R scripts you would need to use `#`so that your comments are not read as code. 

In R and R Markdown, the software that allows the conversion from R code into different document formats is called [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/index.html).  


Let's get to learning how to use R Markdown!



## The best part! Inserting R code

One of the most powerful and useful features of Rmarkdown, is its ability to
combine text and code in the same document! You can insert plots by including a
code chunk like below. The options added to the code chunk tell it to add a
caption, and set the height and width of the figure.

We do this by inserting a `code chunk`. A code chunk can be inserted pressing 
`Ctrl + Alt + I` or `Cmd + Option + I` for Mac users.


<pre class="markdown"><code>&#96;&#96;&#96;{r plot_sepal, fig.cap="Figure title here", fig.height=8, fig.width=8, echo=FALSE}
plot(Sepal.Length ~ Sepal.Width, data = iris)
&#96;&#96;&#96;
</code></pre>

```{r intro_rmd_plot_sepal, fig.cap="Figure title here", fig.height=8, fig.width=8, echo=FALSE}
plot(Sepal.Length ~ Sepal.Width, data = iris)
```



You can also hide the code chunk but keep the output by using the `echo=FALSE` option:

<pre class="markdown"><code>&#96;&#96;&#96;{r, echo=FALSE}
cor(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Sepal.Width)
&#96;&#96;&#96;
</code></pre>

```{r, echo=FALSE}
cor(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Sepal.Width)
```

In this case we want to keep the code chunk visible and we also want to add some comments
regarding our graph. 

You can also create tables by using the `kable()` function in the knitr package.

<pre class="markdown"><code>&#96;&#96;&#96;{r}
knitr::kable(head(iris), caption = "Table caption here")
&#96;&#96;&#96;
</code></pre>

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(head(iris), caption = "Table caption here")
```

The `knitr::` part of the code tells R where the `kable` function comes from. So
the `::` is telling R "hey, look in the knitr package for the kable function".

For small and not too complex tables, you can also create it outside of a R
chunk using the Markdown syntax:

```
|       &nbsp;       | diverged | polymorphic |
|:------------------:|:--------:|:-----------:|
|   **synonymous**   |   1300   |    2109     |
| **non-synonymous** |   700    |     891     |
```

gives...

|       &nbsp;       | diverged | polymorphic |
|:------------------:|:--------:|:-----------:|
|   **synonymous**   |   1300   |    2109     |
| **non-synonymous** |   700    |     891     |




### Exercise: Create a plot and add a table to your R Markdown document

Time: 10 min

Open RStudio and create an `R Markdown` document:

**File -> New File -> R Markdown**
Save the file and call the file `exercise.Rmd`

Create a chunck of code and create a plot using the database `CO2`. 


1. Use `names(CO2)` to find the names of columns from the CO2 dataset. Choose
two columns. Create a code chunk with a caption `fig.cap` option and the
`fig.width` of 10 and a `fig.height` of 6. Include in the code chunk the
function, replacing the `__` with the two columns you chose:

    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    ggplot(CO2, aes(x =___, y = ___)) +
      geom____()
    ```

2. Create a table of the `head()` of the `CO2` dataset using the R function
`knitr::kable()`.

3. Add a few lines of text underneath your graph

Compile your document by pressing the icon `Knit to HTML` or by typing `Ctrl-Shift-K`.

## Markdown syntax

Similarly to a text editor, R Markdown allows you to modify and customize the syntax.


### Headers 

Such as for a section, subsection, subsubsection, etc.

> `# Header 1`
> 
> gives...
> 
> # Header 1

> `## Header 2`
> 
> gives...
> 
> ## Header 2

> `### Header 3`
> 
> gives...
> 
> ### Header 3

### Text formatting

- `**bold**` gives **bold**. 
- `*italics*` gives *italics*.
- `super^script^` gives super^script^.
- `sub~script~` gives sub~script~.

### Lists

Unnumbered list:

> ```
> - item 1
> - item 2
> - item 3
> ```
>
> gives...
>
> - item 1
> - item 2
> - item 3

Numbered list:

> ```
> 1. item 1
> 2. item 2
> 3. item 3
> ```
>
> gives...
>
> 1. item 1
> 2. item 2
> 3. item 3

### Block quotes

One can also create quotes:

> ```
> > Block quote 
> ```
>
> gives...
>
> > Block quote 


### Exercise: Construct an outline for a (hypthetical) paper

Time: 10 min


In your R Markdown document, add the sections of your future manuscript.
Include the following "Header 1" `#` sections:

- Abstract
- Introduction
- Material and Methods
- Results
- Discussion
- Conclusion



- Write some random words below the **Abstract section**, while using bold and
italics.
- Include an unnumbered list below **Introduction** listing two or three fake
objectives.
- Include a "Header 2" (`##`) called "Statistical analysis" below "Material and
Methods".

Compile it by pressing the icon `Knit to HTML` or by typing `Ctrl-Shift-K`. 

### Adding footnotes, pictures, and links to your document

Footnotes can be done using the following command:

> ```
> Footnote[^1]
>
> [^1]: Footnote content
> ```
>
> gives...
>
> Footnote[^1]
>
> [^1]: Footnote content

A .png .jpeg or .pdf image can be attached in the following way:

> ```
> ![image caption](images/au_coders.jpeg)
> ```
>
> gives...
>
> ![image caption](images/au_coders.jpeg)

And a link can be linked in the following format:

> ```
> [Link](https://google.com)
> ```
>
> gives...
>
> [Link](https://google.com)

### Exercise: Add more to your Markdown document!

Time: 8 min

Now you are asked to include in your "skecthed article" what we just have learned.

1. Include a random picture with caption (of your research or of any .png you
find in your PC).
2. Include a footnote.
3. Include the link of the AUOC webpage (`https://au-oc.github.io`) in your document.
 

**Starting from here I feel that we are adding too much stuff.... i.e. inline code, citing literature and adding themes**

### Inline R code

You can also include R code within the text. You can use this to directly insert
numbers into the text of the document. By using something like:

> The mean of the sepal length is <code>&#96;r round(mean(iris$Sepal.Length), 2)&#96;</code>.
>
> Gives...
>
> The mean of the sepal length is `r round(mean(iris$Sepal.Length), 2)`.


## Other features

### Citing literature with Rmarkdown

If you want to insert a citation use `[@Hoejsgaard2006a]` to get it to look
like: [@Hoejsgaard2006a]... the reference is then inserted onto the bottom of
the document. You need to add a line to the YAML header like this:

```
---
title: "My report"
author: "Me!"
bibliography: my_references.bib
---
```

### Making your report prettier

This really only applies to HTML and PDF[^tinytex] documents. If you want to change the 
theme, add an option to the YAML header so it looks like:

```
---
title: "My report"
output:
    html_document:
        theme: sandstone
---
```



Check out the R Markdown
[documentation](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html#appearance-and-style)
for more types of themes you can use for HTML documents.

[^tinytex]: Knitting to PDF will require that you install LaTeX using the
[tinytex](https://yihui.name/tinytex/r/) R package. After you install LaTeX you
can create truly beautifully typeset PDF documents.

## Ending remarks
