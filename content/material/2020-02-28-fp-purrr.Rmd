# Writing R code that iterates more efficiently

## First steps: Project setup and exploring the data

Like most teaching sessions, we'll start with creating an R project. 
R projects are incredibly useful tools and we strongly recommend you use them.
Create a new project, name it "iterating-with-purrr". 
Once the R project has been opened, create two new files and save them as 
`code-along.R` and `exercises.R`.

Next, let's get familiar with the data we'll be using for this session, 
which is the {{DATA}} dataset. 
Open up the `code-along.R` file and we'll add these to the file:

```{r load-packages-see-data}
# Import the packages we'll use
library(tidyverse)

# Content
# {{DATA}}
```

## Exercise: Try out ...

Time: 10-15 min

In the `exercises.R` script,
copy the code below into the script. 
Then do the following:
