## Objectives

By the end of this session, you will be able to:

- Efficiently iterate over one or more vectors or lists by applying the `map`
family of functions from the purrr package.

**Resources** for continuing learning and help are available on
the [More Info](/more-info/#resources) page.

# Writing R code that iterates more efficiently with package purrr

While in other programming languages, 
iterating over many items in a vector or list requires using a "for loop".
However, R has many powerful tools that simplify this iteration with the
use of "mapping" functions.
"Mapping" involves taking a vector 
(a sequence of numbers, characters, or other data types) 
and applying a function to each of the item in the vector at the same time.
This can greatly simplify code 
and allows the user to be quite expressive in translating analysis ideas to code.

While base R has some useful functions like `apply()`,
the purrr package bundles these "mapping" functionality into a consistent 
and fairly intuitive interface (not to mention excellent documentation on
their [website](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/)). 
In this session we'll cover some of purrr's functions.

## First steps: Project setup

Like most teaching sessions, we'll first start with creating an R project.
R projects are incredibly useful tools and we strongly recommend you use them.
Create a new project, name it "iterating-with-purrr".
Once the R project has been opened, create two new files and save them as
`code-along.R` and `exercises.R`.

Open up the `code-along.R` file and add these to the top of the file:

```{r load-packages-see-data, message=FALSE}
# Import the packages we'll use
library(tidyverse)
```

## `map`ing with purrr

We're going to learn about the `map*` family from package purrr.

### When not iterating

Often you many need to apply the same function to each element of a list or vector. 
Let's use an example with a list of vectors (with randomly generated data):

```{r create-example-list}
set.seed(1)
samples <- list(
  samp1 = runif(5),
  samp2 = rnorm(10, 3),
  samp3 = rgamma(7, 1)
)
```

What if we want to find out the number of values in each samples. 
Using `length()` may come to mind, but `length()` only outputs a single value:

```{r length-samples}
length(samples)
```

`length(samples)` returns the number of list items in `samples`, 
but doesn't find the length of each item in the list which is what we want to know.
So instead, we want to apply `length()` to each vector in `samples`. 
We could do this repeatedly on each individual item:

```{r length-all-list-items}
length(samples$samp1)
length(samples$samp2)
length(samples$samp3)
```

But this approach is quite tedious, too manual 
(any change in the names of the list requires you to change the code here),
and prone to human error.
The problem gets worse when you have more items in the list.
Thankfully, we can use purrr's functions to do this for us.

### The map functions

The `map()` function from purrr is the most general of the functions, 
so let's cover it first.
`map()`, like all the map functions, is fairly simple in what you give it:
It takes a list or vector and a function as arguments.

```{r fig-map-basics, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Visual of basic usage of map arguments. Image from [purrr basics](https://dcl-prog.stanford.edu/purrr-basics.html) section."}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dcl-docs/prog/master/images/map-step-1.png") 
```

`map()` applies the given function to each element of the input list or vector.

```{r fig-map-to-each, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Visual of function applying to each item when using map. Image from [purrr basics](https://dcl-prog.stanford.edu/purrr-basics.html) section."}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dcl-docs/prog/master/images/map-step-2.png") 
```

After the function is applied to each element, 
map outputs the results based on the number of elements in the list or vector.

```{r fig-map-output-pre, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Visual of output of the function from each item. Image from [purrr basics](https://dcl-prog.stanford.edu/purrr-basics.html) section."}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dcl-docs/prog/master/images/map.png") 
```

Finally, `map()` puts these output items into a list.

```{r fig-map-output-final, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Visual of final output of using map. Image from [purrr basics](https://dcl-prog.stanford.edu/purrr-basics.html) section."}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dcl-docs/prog/master/images/map-output.png")
```

Let's see an example of using `map()`:

```{r using-map}
map(samples, length)
```

Notice a small difference here. 
We use `length` instead of `length()` to indicate the function to use. 
The reason is that R evaluates `length()` first before being given to `map()`
because the added `()` tell R it needs to do an action,
which isn't want we want. 
We want `map()` to take the `length` function object 
and use the function later on each item of the list or vector given.

The nice thing about purrr functions is that they are *consistent*.
`map()` returns a list:

```{r}
typeof(map(samples, length))
```

But maybe we want something different. 
While, by adding an ending to `map`, we can easily output something different.
purrr also has these other variations:

* `map_int()` outputs an integer vector.
* `map_dbl()` outputs a double vector.
* `map_chr()` outputs a character vector.
* `map_lgl()` outputs a logical vector.

So, since `length()` returns integers, 
let's use use `map_int()` to create an integer vector instead of a list.

```{r}
map_int(samples, length)
typeof(map_int(samples, length))
```

Here is a visual demonstration:

```{r fig-mapint-basic, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Visual of using `map_int()`. Image from [purrr basics](https://dcl-prog.stanford.edu/purrr-basics.html) section."}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dcl-docs/prog/master/images/map-int.png")
```

Which outputs a vector instead of a list:

```{r fig-mapint-output, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Visual of output of `map_int()`. Image from [purrr basics](https://dcl-prog.stanford.edu/purrr-basics.html) section."}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dcl-docs/prog/master/images/map-int-output.png")
```

The other versions of `map()` produce double (numeric), character, 
and logical vectors just as `map_int()` does.

Let's try using another function, like `median()`:

```{r}
map(samples, median)
```

Since the output is a numeric type (a double), we could use `map_dbl()`:

```{r}
map_dbl(samples, median)
```

### Using map on data.frames/tibbles

We know `map()` works on lists or vectors, 
and so far we've only used it on the object `samples`.
But data.frames (also known as tibbles in the tidyverse),
are also essentially lists, that are put together in columns.
The elements within a tibble are the vector columns (aka lists),
which means that `map()` can work on the data by column (not row).
Let's use the example from the `seals` dataset that has data on seal movements.

```{r}
seals
```

We can use map to find the median of each column:

```{r}
map_dbl(seals, median)
```

### Exercise: Practice using the `map` family

Time: 10-15 min

Copy and paste the below code into the `exercises.R` file.
Using the `economics` dataset, complete these tasks.

1. Calculate the `range` of each column. Use the standard `map()` function.
Notice that the function outputs multiple values (not just one).
    a. Try the same thing, but use `map_dbl()` instead. What happens? 
    Why do you think that is? What does the error say?
2. Find out the standard deviation (`sd`) of each column, 
using the `map_*` function that outputs numeric values (i.e. "double").
3. Check that all the columns are the same `length` by using `map_int()`
4. We've provided a function to calculate if there are no missing values in each column.
Use this function to find out if any columns have missing values. 
Use the `map_lgl()` family to output the results to logic.

```{r exercise-practice-map, eval=FALSE}
# 1. What's the range for each column?
___(economics, ___)

# 1a. Do the same as above, but with map_dbl()
___(economics, ___)

# 2. What are the columns SD?
___(economics, sd)

# 3. What are the columns lengths?
___(economics, ___)

# 4. Are there any missing?
no_missing <- function(x) {
  all(!is.na(x))   ## or !anyNA(x)
}
___(economics, ___)
```

### Giving arguments to the function used in map

So far we've given map a single function and leave the other arguments as default.
But we can pass the function arguments to map as well.
For example, let's say we wanted to `sort()` the numbers.

```{r}
map(samples, sort)
```

Notice they are in increasing order. But what if we wanted it in decreasing order?
The default for `sort()` is that `decreasing = FALSE`. 
So to change it, we need to use `TRUE` instead, which would look like:

```{r}
sort(samples$samp1, decreasing = TRUE)
```

Within `map()`, you can put the function arguments directly after the function name
(passed as `...` in the argument list of `map()`).

```{r}
map(samples, sort, decreasing = TRUE)
```

You can use as many arguments as you'd like in `map()`,
and it will automatically add them to the function.

```{r fig-passing-args, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Visual of final output of using map. Image from [purrr basics](https://dcl-prog.stanford.edu/purrr-basics.html) section."}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dcl-docs/prog/master/images/map-extra-arg.png")
```

Here's another example. 
This code passes to two additional arguments to the `quantile()` function
to calculate the 95th quantile for each sample and removing any missing values. 

```{r}
map_dbl(samples, quantile, probs = 0.95, na.rm = TRUE)
```

### Output tibbles with `map_dfr()` and `map_dfc()`

There are also two other useful versions of map: `map_dfr()` and `map_dfc()`. 
Both of these output a tibble rather than a vector or list.

As with the other versions of map, these `_df*()` versions take a vector or list
and a function as arguments. 
Note, the function must output a tibble in order for `map_df*()` to work.

```{r fig-map-df-process, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Visual of process for mapping out data frames. Image from [purrr extras](https://dcl-prog.stanford.edu/purrr-extras.html) section."}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dcl-docs/prog/master/images/map_df.png")
```

After applying the function and output a tibble, 
`map_df*` then combines these into a single tibble.
You combine by row with `map_dfr()` so each tibble is stacked on top of each other:

```{r fig-map-df-row, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Visual of stacking by row. Image from [purrr extras](https://dcl-prog.stanford.edu/purrr-extras.html) section."}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dcl-docs/prog/master/images/map_dfr.png")
```

Or by column with `map_dfc()` so each tibble is stacked side by side.

```{r fig-map-df-column, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Visual of stacking by column. Image from [purrr extras](https://dcl-prog.stanford.edu/purrr-extras.html) section."}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dcl-docs/prog/master/images/map_dfc.png")
```

`map_dfr()` is especially useful when reading in data from multiple files.
Let's try it out. First we'll read in the csv normally.

```{r, message=FALSE}
url_folder <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dcl-docs/prog/master/data/purrr-extras"
# use paste0 to add on the url path
read_csv(paste0(url_folder, "/file_001.csv"))
read_csv(paste0(url_folder, "/file_002.csv"))
read_csv(paste0(url_folder, "/file_003.csv"))
```

Since `read_csv()` outputs a tibble, 
we are able to use `map_dfr()` to map over each filename 
and combine each individual tibble into one tibble.

```{r, message=FALSE}
(files <- paste0(url_folder, "/file_00", 1:3, ".csv"))
map_dfr(files, read_csv)
```

Each individual tibble can have different numbers of rows or different columns.
`map_dfr()` will create a new column for each unique column name.
For those tibbles without the column, 
`map_dfr()` will add the column and fill it with `NA` values.

```{r, message=FALSE}
read_csv(paste0(url_folder, "/file_004.csv"))
map_dfr(paste0(url_folder, "/file_00", 1:4, ".csv"), read_csv)
```


### Anonymous functions

We've so far given `map()` **named** functions. 
Named functions are those functions that you typically use and see.
For instance, here is a named function that converts kilometers to miles.

```{r}
km_to_miles <- function(x) {
  x * 0.62
}
```

Now when we want to convert kilometers to miles, we use `km_to_miles()`.

```{r}
km_to_miles(22)
```

To apply `km_to_miles()` to the `samples` with `map()`, we do as we have done so far:

```{r}
map(samples, km_to_miles)
```

But, if we don't want to use this function again, 
it doesn't make sense to make it a named function.
Instead, we can use an anonymous (i.e. *unnamed*) function.
These look like:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
function(x) x * 0.62
```

The only real difference is we don't assign the function with an object name.
`map()` can take these anonymous functions just like named functions:

```{r}
map(samples, function(x) x * 0.62)
```

But this syntax can be cumbersome, so purrr uses a shortcut:

```{r}
map(samples, ~ . * 0.62)
```

The `~` tells `map()` the function is an anonymous one.
The `.` tells the function to use the item given from the list `samples` when it iterates.

### Using two vectors or lists as input

With `map()`, you can only give it one vector or list object.
But purrr has another function that can take two vectors or lists: `map2()`.
If you want to use more than two vectors, the function is called `pmap()`,
but we won't be cover it today.

`map2()` is very similar to `map()`, byt takes two input vectors or lists.

```{r fig-map2, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Visual of how map2 works. Image from [purrr parallel](https://dcl-prog.stanford.edu/purrr-parallel.html) section."}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dcl-docs/prog/master/images/map2.png")
```

For example, let's create two vectors `x` and `y`.

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, 4)
y <- c(6, 5, 3.5)
```

We can use `map2()` to iterate on both vectors at the same time. 
It iterates by going on the first item of `x` *and* `y`, then the second, and so on.

```{r}
map2(x, y, min)
```

Just like `map()`, 
`map2()` has the same variants like `map2_int()`, `map2_dfr()`, or `map2_chr()`.
For example:

```{r}
map2_dbl(x, y, min)
```

### Final exercise:

Time: 10-15 min

We're going to show several pieces of code that we haven't covered, 
but we use because it is a great example of when map is useful.
Copy and paste the code into the `exercise.R` file.
Here, we want to run multiple linear models (`lm()`) based on different formulas.
But we don't want to type up each formula

*Note*: All `map` functions are designed to be pipable (`%>%`), so we use that here.

1. Run `map()` on the `model_formulas` and use the `economics` dataset for the `data` argument.
2. Check the summary of all the models by applying `summary` with `map()`.
3. Add another formula to the list checking how personal consumption (`pce`) relates
to unemployment duration (`uempmed`) and personal savings (`psavert`) 
(`"pce ~ psavert + psavert"`). Re-run the code and see how another model is added.

```{r exercise-multiple-models, eval=FALSE}
# Here is the list of formulas
model_formulas <- list(
  # Personal consumption by population and unemployment rate
  "pce ~ pop + unemploy",
  # Personal consumption by personal savings and unemployment rate
  "pce ~ psavert + unemploy"
)

# 1. Run multiple models
model_list <- ___ %>% 
  # Use as.formula so lm recognizes the character formulas
  ___(~ lm(as.formula(.), data = ___))

# 2. Check summary of models
model_list %>% 
  ___(___)

# 3. Extract model results and combine into dataframe
model_list %>% 
  ___(broom::tidy)
```

After doing that, next try and: 

- Replace the `economics` data frame with the `swiss` dataset.
- Remove the current formulas and replace them with these ones:
    - `"Fertility ~ Education + Agriculture"`
    - `"Fertilitiy ~ Examination + Catholic"`
    - `"Infant.Mortality ~ Education + Fertility"`
- Re-run the code

## Additional comments

There's lots of other useful things that purrr provides. 
Check out the purrr [website](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/) 
for documentation on what else you can do.

Another useful thing with using purrr is that if you want to,
you can easily implement parallel processing for your computationally demanding analyses.
All you have to do is use the [furrr package](https://github.com/DavisVaughan/furrr)
and make minor changes to purrr code to run parallel processing.
