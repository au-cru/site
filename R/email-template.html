<p>Hey everyone!</p>

<p>For February, we have only one code-along and the monthly hacky hour. If you're just getting these emails for the first time, it probably is because the previous emails were going to your spam filter. We changed our mailing list provider so hopefully these update emails don't get sent to spam anymore! So, we're starting up again with three sessions in January:</p>

{table_of_events}

<p>If you want more information about the events (among other things), find them on our <strong>website</strong> <a href="https://cru.au.dk">cru.au.dk</a>. There is also a <strong>calendar</strong> you can <a href="https://au-cru.github.io/site/more-info/#add-calendar">import/subscribe to</a>! And if you want to help us out, fill out <a href="https://au-cru.github.io/site/surveys/">these surveys</a> so we know what everyone is interested in. And! We also got a <strong>twitter</strong> account up! Check out <a href="https://twitter.com/aucru">@aucru</a> on Twitter.</p>
